# Portfolio Project: Happy Customers
## Introduction
The main focus of this project is on a recent survey to a select customer cohort done by one of the fastest growing startups in the logistics and delivery domain that thrives on making their customers happy. A subset of this data is provided.
The primary objective of this project is to predict if a customer is happy or not based on the answers they have given to the questions asked based on different predictive models. The models considered for prediction are *Logistic Regression, Deep Learning, and Ensemble Learning models*.

## Data Description
*Y* = Target attribute with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers
*X1* = My order was delivered on time
*X2* = Contents of my order was as I expected
*X3* = I ordered everything I wanted to order
*X4* = I paid a good price for my order
*X5* = I am satisfied with my courier
*X6* = The app makes ordering easy for me

Attributes X1 to X6 indicate the responses for each question and have values from 1 to 5; the smallest number indicates less likely and the highest number indicates more likely towards the answer.
